## Downstream Analysis  
After analyzing with these applications, some downstream analyses may be required. For guidance on these analyses, please refer to the Jupyter notebooks beginning with **"Chapter"** in the [notebook folder](https://github.com/dhino2000/optic/tree/main/notebook). These notebooks provide step-by-step examples and instructions for some downstream analysis workflows.

	abstract = {Two-photon microscopy of calcium-dependent sensors has enabled unprecedented recordings from vast populations of neurons. While the sensors and microscopes have matured over several generations of development, computational methods to process the resulting movies remain inefficient and can give results that are hard to interpret. Here we introduce Suite2p: a fast, accurate and complete pipeline that registers raw movies, detects active cells, extracts their calcium traces and infers their spike times. Suite2p runs on standard workstations, operates faster than real time, and recovers ~2 times more cells than the previous state-of-the-art method. Its low computational load allows routine detection of ~10,000 cells simultaneously with standard two-photon resonant-scanning microscopes. Recordings at this scale promise to reveal the fine structure of activity in large populations of neurons or large populations of subcellular structures such as synaptic boutons.},

	doi = {10.1101/2024.02.10.579780},
	publisher = {Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory},
	abstract = {Generalist methods for cellular segmentation have good out-of-the-box performance on a variety of image types. However, existing methods struggle for images that are degraded by noise, blurred or undersampled, all of which are common in microscopy. We focused the development of Cellpose3 on addressing these cases, and here we demonstrate substantial out-of-the-box gains in segmentation and image quality for noisy, blurry or undersampled images. Unlike previous approaches, which train models to restore pixel values, we trained Cellpose3 to output images that are well-segmented by a generalist segmentation model, while maintaining perceptual similarity to the target images. Furthermore, we trained the restoration models on a large, varied collection of datasets, thus ensuring good generalization to user images. We provide these tools as {\textquotedblleft}one-click{\textquotedblright} buttons inside the graphical interface of Cellpose as well as in the Cellpose API.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},
